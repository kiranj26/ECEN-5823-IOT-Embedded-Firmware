# Gesture-Enabled Interactive Classroom Display System
### Course: ECEN 5823 IoT Firmware Fall 2023

## Overview
The "Gesture-Enabled Interactive Classroom Display System" is an innovative project developed as part of the ECEN 5823 IoT Firmware course. This system aims to transform the educational experience by integrating gesture and motion sensor technologies for interactive classroom management and content delivery.

## Project Team
- Ayswariya Kannan - ayka9480@colorado.edu
- Kiran Narendra Jojare - kijo7257@colorado.edu

## Objectives
The project's objective is to create a prototype system that:
- Facilitates seamless interaction with educational content via gesture control.
- Enhances classroom dynamics and energy management using a PIR motion sensor.

## Key Features
- **Gesture-Controlled Interface:** Utilizing an APDS-9960 sensor for dynamic interaction with digital displays.
- **Energy Management:** Incorporating a PIR motion sensor for effective power usage and monitoring classroom activity.
- **Real-Time Communication:** Custom BLE GATT Services for transmitting gesture and PIR sensor data.

## Use Cases
- Interactive teaching in classrooms.
- Enhanced presentation control in professional settings.
- Potential applications in public spaces for gesture-based interactions.

## Future Enhancements
- Over-The-Air (OTA) updates for system maintenance.
- Advanced gesture recognition capabilities.
- Exploration of battery-powered server options and upgraded LCD displays.

## System Architecture
- **Server:** Integrates gesture and PIR sensors, managing input and energy efficiency.
- **Client:** Responsive display adapting to gesture commands and classroom activity.
